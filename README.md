Project Overview
This project involves the exploration and analysis of car accident data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help in understanding the key factors contributing to road accidents.
Using Tableau, interactive dashboards have been built to visualize accident distribution based on location, time, weather conditions, and other critical variables.

The objective is to provide a comprehensive, data-driven approach to road safety and highlight areas for potential preventive measures.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key factors such as weather, time, and location contributing to accidents.

Interactive Dashboards for:

Accident frequency by time of day and day of week.

Geographic distribution of accidents.

Impact of weather and road conditions on accident severity.

Year-over-year trends in accident occurrences.

Data Cleaning and preprocessing to ensure high-quality insights.

User-friendly Visualizations to assist stakeholders in decision-making.

Tools and Technologies
Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard creation.

Excel / CSV Data: Data source for accident records.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and inconsistent entries.

Outcomes
Identified peak accident hours and high-risk zones.

Established correlation between weather conditions and accident severity.

Provided actionable insights for traffic safety improvements.
